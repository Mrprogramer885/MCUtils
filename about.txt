Bunker blocks with creeper, tnt and wither protection tiers.

3eye and performance
This mod is very lightweight, making it good choice for players with low pc specs.
Our rendering engine uses technology caled 3eye which renders the texture by 4x4 then 8x8 and then 16x16, this all 
happens in 50-100 miliseconds so you wont even see the difference.
Minecraft renders every texture immediately by 16x16 in miliseconds, this can increase the gpu demand but also leads to lover rendering time
3eye renders 4x4, then 8x8 and 16x16 so the gpu is being used at lower demand but it takes 50-100 miliseconds to render all textures (you wont see the difference ofc)
3eye config can be found in the instance config folder.
