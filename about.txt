3eye and performance
This mod is very lightweight, making it good choice for players with low pc specs.
Our rendering engine uses technology caled 3eye which renders items, 3D objects, items and textures (only from the mod) using completely differently alghorhitms than minecraft uses so performance is better.
This mod also has "Performance mode", which you can use when the game is extremely laggy, what it does is the mod render every item slower thus reducing GPU demand and kills some of the mod functions thus reducing CPU demand.
(Be aware that this setting will disable some of the mod functions so use ONLY if the game really lags)
